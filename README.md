# Building Dataset
High-speed Rail Line Building Dataset Display

This Project is created to introduce and display our proposed High-speed Rail Line (HSR) Building Dataset.

The dataset is introduced in detail in file "[1] High-speed Rail (HSR) Line Building Dataset Introduction.pdf". The dataset includes two sub-datasets, i.e., Zhengzhou-Xi’an HSR Line Building Dataset and Beijing-Shanghai HSR Line Building Dataset.

The Zhengzhou-Xi’an HSR Line Building Dataset is displayed in file "[2] Zhengzhou-Xi’an HSR Line Building Dataset Display.pdf".

The Beijing-Shanghai HSR Line Building Dataset is displayed in file "[3] Beijing-Shanghai HSR Line Building Dataset Display.pdf".

Three original images and corresponding labeled samples are provided in "Data Samples" folder. We will open all the data in the dataset later to support related scientific research.
